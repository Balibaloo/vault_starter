its realy fucking annoying that knowledge cannot be categorised
theres computer shit
physical shit
theoretical shit
mathematical shit
logic shit
and its all so interlinked
this is why we need [[networked knowledge|networked thinking]]
just that i havent realy been doing it

i must collect all my notes on [[networked knowledge|networked note]] taking
[[how to take smart notes]]

the idea is that you shouldnt worry about structure because structure [[emergence|emerges]]

so i have a note lets say on APIs
to be considered "placed" or "connected", it needs to:
1. ==aliased and linked to other notes that mention it==
2. be internally linked to other notes mentioned in the note

this creates the network
then [[map of content|MOCS]] give you visibility into this network
