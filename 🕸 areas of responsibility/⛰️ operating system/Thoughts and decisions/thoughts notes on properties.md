thoughts on properties
taking notes on properties is hard because that entails making a lot of notes
eg non determinism
there are many things to which non determinism applies and where there exist deterministic and non deterministic variants
does that then mean that i should create a note for determinism, and then a note for each deterministic and non determinist variant of some machine
yes
its messy but thats how it is
properties exist, they can be defined generally but when applied to instances, the property itself is seen in a new light

like implementing the property, like an interface, is interesting specifically in individual cases
basically 
yes, create notes for every type of stick
