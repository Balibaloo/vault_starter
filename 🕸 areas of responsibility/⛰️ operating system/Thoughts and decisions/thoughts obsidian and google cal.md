how does this relate to google calendar?
- google calendar stores periodic ones
	- and day to day time blocking of doing tasks
- obsidian stores 
	- knowledge tasks
		- research
		- work
	- as well as the backlog of tasks
		- core values, leading to 
		- goals, leading to
		- projects, leading to backlog of tasks
		- which are then chosen to be done at the beginning of the week
			- simply cut and pasted into weekly note
		- and then it is displayed in the dashboard
		- which prompts me to act on it
		- block time in the calendar
		- and when i do it, i log it
