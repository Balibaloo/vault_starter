one issue i always face when learning is the networked structure of knowledge leads to an [[exponential]] node growth because of a high [[branching factor]]

this is an issue when each node is a very complicated concept

The [[tractability|tractable]] solution is maintain focus on the root node
and only adding information to [[adjacent nodes|neighbouring]] nodes when the information related to the [[adjacent nodes|neighbour]] more than the root.
This leaves the neighbours in a fragmented state, missing key information about themselves.
And so they are still technically empty notes.
