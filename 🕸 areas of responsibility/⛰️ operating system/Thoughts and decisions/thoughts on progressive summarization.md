thoughts on [[progressive summarization]]
basically how do i do this systematically

my key needs are:
- take notes on source
- summarize the source note
- reference the summary outside of the note

---
i have decided to do the following:
- we can take notes on source
	- create headings and such
- then summarize in the first heading called 'summary'
- link to blocks in the summary

this is the simplest solution possible

the downside is that you don't get precise references to the source when linking

---
another possible solution is to create summary notes
that lets me reorganize the content of the source outside of the source note
