daily tasks are here to remind me to do things
and maybe ill end up graphing my stats or something


## task groups
groups of daily tasks are actualy significant
eg, how do i distinguish between a day where i chose not to workout and a day where i forgot to workout?
if a category tasks (supertask) is marked as completed then it i signifies that the subtask data is valid
eg i chose not to workout

otherwise the data is not valid, and i just forgot to input it
