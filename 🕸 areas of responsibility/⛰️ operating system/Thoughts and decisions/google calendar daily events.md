# morning
on one had its nice to have everything in one event
if im busy in the morning, then i can just drag the event to when i woke up and then drag it to when i start working

on the other hand, when i have a bit time, or i dont have breakfast or i don't shower in the morning, it would be nice to break it all up into individual events
like if wake up (the time it takes me to get out of bed after the alarm rings) and then feel like doing a bit of work on notes, like this note
before showering and having breakfast then it would be nice to have them separate

using a js script is also an option
but that would required me to have my computer on system boot

for now im going to split them up
