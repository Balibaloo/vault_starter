i have these three topics that are very interesting at the moment
but i feel that i am in a [[mental squeeze point]]

I've hit another complication with [[cleaning the workbench]]
I don't know what to do with interesting sources
options
- place in relevant moc
- place in the inbox
- place in some "expansion" folder
- another alternative is to create a project with some goal that can encompass some volume of information about a tool or concept.

my question
- should you treat large topics of interests as project

holdup, first
my issue:
- how to keep track of sources that seem useful for specific topics?
	- you cant just dump them in the bottom of the moc
	- if you add a comment to the link as to why it is interesting then its not as bad.

- They need to be stored in a place that I will know to (or be forced to) look when I decide to initiate learning on the topic.
- And some place that will not cause clutter.
- And also in some way that integrates with the task system

you know thinking about the whole project task system
currently project tasks are a subtag of ✔
if we treat any note tagged ✔ as a possible task then we can integrate it into the task system somehow


you know what
for now, im just going to create a source note and place it in the inbox.
