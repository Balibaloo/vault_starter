One of the things holding me back was my aversion to quickly hopping around different tasks.
And I believe it is because traditionally you have to tidy up after yourself and lose track of the exact point at which you left off.
This means that getting back into it takes time and effort.

Workspaces entirely solve that issue.
Obsidian has a built in feature called workspaces which has a handy shortcut: "save and load another workspace".
As the name implies it saves the current workspace before loading the new one. So with one hotkey you can effortlessly save the leading edge of progress and load up a new workspace.
Without worries of loosing anything.
