why do i need a crm:
- remember more about family and friends
- remember more about friends
- remember more about collages


what they are up to
where are they from
where do they come from
what is their history
what they are interested in
dietary restrictions and preferences

we also need different types of people
but also the option for people to be able to have multiple roles

eg
- co worker
- flatmate
- family
- friend
- professional interest
- landlord, ect
