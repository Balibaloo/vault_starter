my system will exist in multiple places for different reasons
- google drive syncs the entire vault to be available on mobile and other devices
- the git repo holds all functionality, without any personal files
	- work pc, clones git repo
- a private git repo (a [[bare repo]]) stored locally keeps track of file history

the idea is that i have a backup of my personal files on the cloud
and a local file history
and then the functionality is backed up in a git repo so that i can create new vault just by cloning the repo
