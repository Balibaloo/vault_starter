another issue i have is when creating new concepts i get scared to create new notes because I'm afraid that they will dangle and get lost
perhaps i can set up something that automatically links the new note to my workbench so I can then keep track of all the new notes that i make and then delete the things that i feel are small and sufficiently linked and otherwise i would map it in some [[map of content|MOC]]

but dont be afraid
Nickolas luhman made disposable "current important links" cards
