# value proposal
A page that can be used to quickly navigate the vault
based on your desired actions
eg:
- meditate
- uni work
- work on the system
- ect


# impacted use cases
- none

# relevant plugins
- none

# TODOs

# notes
maybe the main page
maybe a sub page

a page to provide you with the resources to switch into different contexts
the only one i can think of now is
note taking/reading?
maybe one for processing?
idk
