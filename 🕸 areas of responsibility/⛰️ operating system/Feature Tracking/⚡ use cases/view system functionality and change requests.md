### Thoughts
First of all, what is a workflow?
Before looking around my vault:
I intend it to be a unit of functionality that can be referenced
the thing is that a lot of things are very fluid and tt's hard to define
the only way i can think to change proof a definition is by setting the beginning and end points of a workflow
i.e. a goal to achieve a task
- create a task
- note-taking
	- this is a large workflow with many sub flows
		- eg source, vs concept

ugh like this is hard
im creating a change management system to keep track of all the functionality of my system
including plugins that i use
and what i use them for
and changes over time to the functionality
maybe thats a better word

im trying to describe a function that i preform
that takes me from point A to point B using some plugins

what happens if more functionality gets added and it now takes me to point B2

then it becomes a different use case or a compound use case

awesome
we have a name for it, [[use cases|use case]]

now how precise do we want these use cases to be?
i want the use cases to be extendable
ie their value proposal to be extendable but still fall under the use case
eg create a task definiton, should allow creating a gcal event for the task
