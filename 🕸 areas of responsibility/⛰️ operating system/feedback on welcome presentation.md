give personal more examples
try and prepend theory with examples

our approach to organizing knowledge is physical
we think we need partitions
like a library or a drawer of socks and underwear

but knowledge isn't physical
it doesent need to be neatly laid out physically

get rid of the wall of text
presentation needs to be minimal and visually appealing

Computers act as libraries for us
Dig into why libraries are bad

So there are physical organizational methods
Poems use association to draw images

Our brains are not physical
They are associative



You smell something
You know where you were
Who you were with
All the other smells become irrelevant

We treat information as if it were physical
But it's not

Eliminate wall of texts
