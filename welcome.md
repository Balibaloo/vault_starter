# What is this?
- a [[note taking]] system
- and most importantly, a place for everything to interlink [[networked knowledge|networked thought]]

## key concepts
1) [[Networked Knowledge]]
	- a methodology for effective [[note taking]] that mimics the way our brains think to maximise learning and value
2) [[PARA]] application agnostic file organisation
3) Custom management tools
	- system [[⚡ Use Cases MOC]] and [[✔ CRM Dashboard|✔ Change Request Dashboard]]
		- for keeping track of the functionality of the system
	- knowledge capture and processing (WIP)
	- [[⚡ Use Cases MOC#Projects|projects use cases]] and (WIP)
	- [[⚡ Use Cases MOC#periodic notes|periodic note use cases]] (WIP)
		- daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly notes
		- task management
			- [[day todo|daily todo dashboard]]
		- journaling
			- `="[[🗃 resources/🗄 logs/⌛ periodic/weekly/" + dateformat(date(today), "yyyy-'W'WW") + " | Weekly Journal ]]"`
			- `="[[🗃 resources/🗄 logs/⌛ periodic/monthly/" + dateformat(date(today), "yyyy-MM") + " | Monthly Journal ]]"`

## philosophy
- use emojis wherever possible to improve readability
- notes are only representations of the world, they are merely a [[modelling|model]] to aid in thinking
- It will never be perfect, perfection as a concept doesent exist. You would break perfection as soon as you take the next note.
- Human beings can only work on one piece of information at a time. Which is why you should only focus on the local structure of information. Complex networks of knowledge will [[emergence|emerge]] by themselves.
- "do what is easy",
	- think of "information as food" - Diego Forte
	- eat when you're hungry
	- whenever you are stuck, do something else
- start lots of small things
	- let yourself get sucked into rabbit holes and gather peripheral knowledge
